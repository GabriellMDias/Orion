# Documentation Task Index

Choose the route relevant to the change. Policy pages provide section links for focused reading; related policies apply when the change crosses their boundaries. The repository has the Approval Request server, PostgreSQL persistence, generated SDK, and Phase 6 web workflow. [Selected technologies](architecture/technology-decisions.md) are not proof of [implemented commands](validation.md).

## Decisions and documentation

- [ADR index](adr/README.md): significant decisions and their rationale; status belongs to each ADR.
- [ADR authoring](adr/authoring.md) and [template](adr/template.md): proposals, acceptance, historical integrity, and supersession.
- [Contributing](contributing.md): change workflow, documentation ownership, canonical sources, maintenance, and review.
- [Global agent instructions](../AGENTS.md): invariants, command availability, and conditional routes.

Current policies describe current architectural expectations. ADRs preserve decision history; runbooks describe real current procedures; Git preserves development history. Additional domain/application documentation and generated reference will be added when real sources and owners exist, not as empty placeholders.
